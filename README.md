# Introduction

This calculator is a simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, resembling a traditional handheld calculator, making it intuitive to use for performing quick calculations directly in your web browser.

## How to Use the Calculator

### Opening the Calculator
- Open the `index.html` file in a web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge.

### Entering Numbers
- Click on the numeric buttons (0 through 9) to input numbers.
- The numbers you press will appear on the calculator screen at the top.

### Performing Operations
- After entering the first number, click on an operator button:
  - `+` for addition
  - `−` for subtraction
  - `×` for multiplication
  - `÷` for division
- Enter the second number.
- You can perform chained calculations by continuing to select operators and numbers before pressing the equal sign.

### Using the Decimal Point
- Click the `.` button to input decimal numbers.
- The calculator supports decimal arithmetic for more precise calculations.

### Calculating the Result
- Click the `=` button to compute the result.

- This will clear the current input and any stored values, allowing you to start a new calculation.

## Features Explained

- **Interactive Display**: The calculator screen updates in real-time as you input numbers and operations, showing you the current value or result.
- **Operator Functions**: The calculator supports the four basic arithmetic operations, each triggered by their respective buttons.
- **Chained Calculations**: You don't need to press `=` after every operation. The calculator can handle multiple sequential operations by updating the current result.
- **Error Handling**: The calculator is designed to handle common input errors gracefully, although it's a basic implementation, so complex error detection is minimal.

## Practical Applications

- **Quick Calculations**: Ideal for performing quick math without needing to open a separate calculator app.
- **Educational Tool**: Useful for learning how calculators work or for teaching the basics of programming with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Customization**: Since the source code is accessible, you can modify and expand its functionality, which is great for practice and experimentation.

## Customization and Expansion

Feel free to modify the calculator to suit your needs:

- **Design Tweaks**:
  - Change colors, fonts, and button styles in the `styles.css` file to match your aesthetic preferences.
- **Additional Features**:
  - Add more functions like percentage calculations, square roots, or memory storage by enhancing the `script.js` file.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Improve the CSS to make the calculator responsive to different screen sizes and devices.
